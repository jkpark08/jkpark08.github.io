# Introduction
## EBH dataset
- This is an official dataset for "3D Hand Sequence Recovery from Real Blurry Images and Event Stream, ECCV, 2024".
- Our EBH dataset is the first to capture 3D hand movements with real-world motion blur and their corresponding event information.

## Download
### blur_images.zip
- blurry images captured from 10 individuals.
```bash
blur_images
├── left_xxxxxx
│       └─ cam_00
│           └─ xxxxxx.png
└── right_xxxxxx
        └── cam_00  
            └─ xxxxxx.png
``` 
### events.zip
- event stream divided by 1ms. ~~We will release overall event stream later~~
```bash
events
   └─── left_xxxxxx
         └─ xxx_01.png
         └─ xxx_02.png
         └─ ...
         └─ xxx_11.png
``` 

### annotations.zip
- 3D annotations, including mesh (MANO parameters) and 3D keypoints.
### ~~depth~~
~~We will include it soon~~
### ~~clean images~~
~~We will include it soon~~
